## Overview

All BAYS soccer analysis is based on **8 core metrics** that measure different aspects of youth soccer program performance. These metrics allow fair comparison between towns of different sizes and competitive levels.

## The 8 Core Metrics

### Metric 1: Participation Rate
**Definition:** Teams per 100 school-age students (K-12 enrollment)

**Why It Matters:** Measures how many kids in a town are playing BAYS soccer relative to the total school-age population. Normalizes program size to population.

**Current Rankings (6 Towns):**
1. **Mansfield** - 0.93 teams/100 students
2. **Hopkinton** - 0.84 teams/100 students
3. **Foxborough** - 0.78 teams/100 students
4. Ashland - 0.76 teams/100 students
5. Holliston - 0.74 teams/100 students
6. Bellingham - 0.51 teams/100 students

---

### Metric 2: Win Percentage
**Definition:** (Wins + 0.5 × Ties) / Total Games × 100

**Why It Matters:** Overall competitive success. Measures how often teams win across all divisions and age groups.

**Current Rankings (6 Towns):**
1. **Bellingham** - 55.5%

### Metric 3: Goal Differential per Team
**Definition:** (Total Goals For - Total Goals Against) / Total Teams

**Why It Matters:** More nuanced than win percentage - shows margin of victory/defeat. Positive = winning by multiple goals on average, negative = losing.

**Current Rankings (6 Towns):**
1. **Mansfield** - +2.95 goals/team
2. **Ashland** - +2.79 goals/team
3. **Bellingham** - +1.14 goals/team

### Metric 4: Spring Retention Rate
**Definition:** (Average Spring Teams / Average Fall Teams) × 100

**Why It Matters:** Measures program quality and player satisfaction. Good programs retain players from Fall to Spring. Poor retention suggests issues with coaching, competition, or player experience.

**Current Rankings (6 Towns):**
1. **Mansfield** - 101.3% (gains teams!)
2. **Bellingham** - 98.0%
3. **Holliston** - 88.3%

**Why It Matters:** Measures defensive ability and goalkeeping across the program. Lower = better defensive coaching/organization.

**Current Rankings (6 Towns):**
1. **Mansfield** - 18.61 goals/team
2. **Holliston** - 19.67 goals/team
3. **Bellingham** - 19.84 goals/team
4. Ashland - 20.48 goals/team
5. Foxborough - 21.66 goals/team
6. Hopkinton - 22.11 goals/team

### Metric 7: Competitive Level (Division Distribution)

### Metric 8: Gender Balance

## How to Use These Metrics

### For Program Evaluation
Compare your town to others of similar size:
- **Small towns** (<2,500 students): Bellingham
- **Medium towns** (2,500-3,500 students): Foxborough, Holliston, Ashland, Mansfield
- **Large towns** (3,500+ students): Hopkinton, Walpole, Westborough

### For Identifying Weaknesses
Look for metrics where your town ranks poorly:
- Low retention → coaching or program quality issues
- Low win % → player development issues
- Poor division placement → not competitive enough
- Low participation → marketing or program awareness issues

### For Benchmarking
Set targets based on best-in-class performance:
- **Participation:** Aim for 0.90+ (Mansfield level)
- **Win %:** Aim for 54%+ (top tier)
- **Retention:** Aim for 95%+ (Bellingham/Mansfield level)
- **Gender Balance:** Aim for 95+ score (near 50/50)

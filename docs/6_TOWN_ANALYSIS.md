## Critical Findings

### 🚨 The FOX Problem

**Every other town outperforms FOX in competitive metrics:**

1. **Win Rate:** All 5 towns win 6-20% more games than FOX
2. **Goal Differential:** All 5 towns have 1.2-5.1 better GD per team
3. **Spring Retention:** All 5 towns retain 8-46% more teams
4. **Offensive Output:** 4 of 5 towns score 7-19% more goals

**FOX is consistently at the bottom despite:**
- Middle-of-pack participation rate (0.78)
- Middle-of-pack competitive division placement (3.08)

This suggests **systemic coaching, player development, or organizational issues** rather than just a small program or weak competition.

## Progress Tracking

**Total:** 10 towns × 18 seasons = 180 collections
**Completed:** 0/180
**Percentage:** 0%

## Tips

1. **Save frequently** - Copy data to a text file after each town/season
2. **Check team counts** - Use expected counts above to verify you got all data
3. **Watch for missing seasons** - Some towns may not have data for older seasons
4. **Verify columns** - Make sure you're getting: Gender, Grade, Div Level, Div Tier, Team Name, W, L, T, Points, GF, GA, Goal Diff, Coach names
5. **Take breaks** - This is tedious work, don't burn out!

## Next Steps After Collection

Once you have the raw data:
1. Save it in a structured format (CSV or Excel)
2. Let me know - I'll help you process and import it into the database
3. We'll validate against the Fall 2024 profile to ensure data quality
